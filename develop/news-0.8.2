Time to release nwcc 0.8.2!

This is a minor update containing various important, mostly AMD64-specific
bugfixes, as well as initial multi-dimensional VLA support.

nwcc now by default does not pretend to be gcc on Linux systems anymore.
It used to do this in order to work around various longstanding C library
header bugs, which no longer seem to be present. GNU mode remains the
default on OSX and BSD. Regardless of the default choice, you can always
ask nwcc to define __GNUC__ by passing it the "-gnu" command line option,
and not to define it by passing "-notgnu". This can also be selected as
a default choice during compilation by using "./configure --gnu" (or
--notgnu), and it can also be put in the configuration file.

(nwcc work had been suspended for over a year because I was working on
other hobby projects in what little spare time I had. Lately I was also
working on a bitfield support rewrite to make it work properly on big
endian targets, but this task is so frustrating and time-consuming that
I'm making a release without those changes in order to get the important
bugfixes out.)
