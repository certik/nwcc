=============

After a three months break from doing nwcc development (I
have been writing an x86 assembler instead), I've finally
done some new nwcc stuff today:

	- I merged the SPARC/Linux support that has been
lying around here for some time. Note that this stuff is
fairly broken in some areas because the Linux ABI seems to
differ from the Solaris ABI, and I haven't gotten around
to fixing that yet

	- I ported to OpenBSD/AMD64. Like Linux/SPARC,
that just involved the usual linker/assembler flags
selection stuff. ABI seems to be compatible with Linux/
FreeBSD on AMD64

Next I'll add support for my new assembler to the NWCC_ASM
environment variable and -asm flag, and release that stuff
as 0.7.1.1 minor nwcc release.

I hope that once my assembler is good enough for use with
nwcc, I can get back to doing some major nwcc development.
The best way to get into it would probably be a PA-RISC/
HP-UX port ;-)

===========

nwcc 0.7.1 is out! This release adds support for the SPARC
architecture. Currently only Solaris on 64bit hardware is
supported. Naturally many bugs are to be expected, and a few
are already known, though the new backend already seems
surprisingly stable to me.

I'm very grateful to Andre van Ruth [www.gnulinux.nl] for
providing access to the SPARC system on which I wrote and
debugged all the new stuff.

Because I developed most of the additions using 32bit nwcc
binaries to generate 64bit SPARC code, I ran into some very
severe cross-compilation bugs, which I fixed (in fact this
was the first time I really made use of the cross-comp
support.)

As usual, the port also showed me a few bugs that went
undetected in other backends; I've fixed some of those for
MIPS and PowerPC, though others remain subject to open
questons.
