===========

Finally it is time to release nwcc 0.8!

This version is primarily a bugfix release. It corrects many bugs
that were found while compiling Apache, PHP, Python and Ruby. Some
of them were stunningly critical for x86 systems running *BSD or
Linux in large file mode ("long long" structure member alignment
was incompatible with gcc's, thereby breaking some uses of "struct
stat" with 64bit members!).

Additionally, nwcc has been ported to Linux/MIPS64 (little endian),
and many basic MIPS bugs have been corrected - And a few SPARC-
and PPC-specific ones as well.

There are still various known compilation bugs on x86. For example,
a few test cases in Tcl's test suite crash an nwcc-compiled Tcl
interpreter, one file of Ruby contains a HUGE struct initializer
list which causes nwcc to use way too much memory, and Perl seems
to crash immediately upon program start (apparently in
pthread_atfork(), possibly due to faulty preceding Pthread wrapper
calls).

However, I have taken a break from nwcc for a month, and now I feel
it is time to get these important changes out now immediately.
