===========

I'm releasing nwcc 0.8.3 to update my mail address - if you tried to contact
me by using the old address (nils<at>gnulinux<dot>nl) and received no response,
please send your message to the new one again (nweller<at>tzi<dot>de). This
version also contains a few AMD64 fixes that had so far only been released in
snapshot "nwcc_0.8.2-120726".

Note that this release has NOT been tested on most supported platforms. Please
report any problems you may encounter.

nwcc development has been on ice due to lack of time, but bug reports, feature
requests and questions are of course still welcome!

Apart from the AMD64 problems that have been solved in 2012, there are still
open AMD64 problems that mostly pertain to floating point and ABI structure
incompatibilities. Some work has gone into trying to fix bitfield ABI problems
on RISC architectures, but this has not been successful (so the relevant code
changes aren't included in this version).

===========

Looking into the whole thing, I was shocked to find that nwcc on AMD64 still
has quite a lot of really fundamental issues, which surprised me even though
it should have been expected because I've been doing most nwcc development
and testing on x86.

A lot of things have been fixed but it's not clear at this point how much
else will come up, I address things as I encounter them right now (position-
independent code seems very weak, Tcl crashes, structs are still not ABI
compatible with gcc, cross-compilation for x86 in a mixed-arch environment
isn't properly supported (-target=x86 works of course, but -m32 doesn't
and the linker and assembler aren't invoked)).

===========

I just picked up nwcc again because I've run into a Linux AMD64 system on which
nwcc 0.8.2 doesn't work because it does not use the correct library directories.
This has been a known problem for some time (reported, among other bugs, by Urs
Jan√üen in 2011) but I hadn't gotten around to fixing it so far.

The configure script now contains a preliminary library directory check which
should fix the problem. During the latest AMD64 tests, various severe ABI
problems have been discovered and will be addressed soon as well.
